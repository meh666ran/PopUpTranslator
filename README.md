# Pop-Up Translator
A simple Program to translate the words in clipboard.

for using this, at first you should install some libraries:
`sudo pip3 install python-bidi googletrans arabic-reshaper clipboard`

if you get any problem with tkinter you should install tk package from your distribution's repository: (I'm sure package names for Arch Linux and Ubuntu)
Arch Linux:
`sudo pacman -S tk`
Ubuntu:
`sudo apt install tk`

Then run the `Pop-Up Translator.py` file and It'll show you the translate of the text in your clipboard.
this program translates english to persian and it'll translate all other languages to english and shows it in a Pop-Up Window as well, and after 5 seconds, Pop-Up Window will destroy Itself. 
you can make a keyboard shortcut for it and anytime you want to translate anything just copy the words or sentences to your clipboard and push the buttons that you defined for shortcut.
